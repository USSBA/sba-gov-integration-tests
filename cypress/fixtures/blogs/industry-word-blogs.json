        "blogSectionText": "<p>Jordan and Kristin Winspear own a construction company that is building a parking garage for the VA Hospital in Boise, Idaho. Not only is the project financially attractive, Jordan says it’s personally gratifying – as a service-disabled veteran of the Coast Guard, he spent ten years getting medical care at that very hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winspear Construction is one of 2.5 million <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SBO_Facts_VOB.pdf\">veteran-owned small businesses</a><a href=\"https://get.adobe.com/reader/\"><img alt=\"Download Adobe Reader to read this link content\" src=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/all/themes/smallbizd7/images/pdf-icon-red.png\" /></a> in the United States. As we recognize next week, November 5-9, 2018, as <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/nvsbw\">National Veterans Small Business Week</a>, I am proud to recognize all of the SBA programs that help veterans, military members transitioning to civilian life, and their spouses start and grow businesses of their own. And it’s my honor to announce a new pilot program aimed at expanding these initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly one in ten small businesses in the U.S. is owned by a veteran. Together, they employ nearly 5 million American workers and produce more than $1 trillion in sales every year. The SBA’s <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ovbd\">Office of Veterans Business Development</a>, along with 22 <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ovbd/resources/1548576\">Veterans Business Outreach Centers</a> nationwide, provides resources specifically designed to help vets and military spouses start or grow a business. Among these are the <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/bootstobusiness\">Boots to Business program</a>, which provides more than 700 entrepreneurship classes a year at 200 American military installations in the U.S. and abroad; and the <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/service-disabled-veteran-owned-small-businesses-program\">Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program</a> for federal contracting, which certifies qualified companies to compete for contracts to sell their products and services to the federal government. The government has an annual goal that 23% of all federal contract dollars go to small businesses – and 3% of those to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. I am proud to note that this goal has been exceeded for the past five years, with 4.1% of government contracts in FY 2017 going to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.</p>\r\n"

Through a Memorandum of Understanding I signed with VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, the SBA and VA will develop and launch an intensive entrepreneurship training program for veterans, helping them improve their management and executive leadership skills. The two Agencies will work together on shaping and scaling this new, in-depth program, and I look forward to our collaboration. Funding for this program comes from President Trump, who showed his dedication to small businesses and to our nation’s veterans by donating his second-quarter salary to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we approach Veterans Day and National Veterans Small Business Week, I encourage all Americans to thank those who have served our country in uniform – and to support their continued success as civilians.</p>\r\n"

From postcards to catalogs, “hot, digitally savvy, direct-to-consumer” brands including Casper, Harry’s, Wayfair, Rover, Quip, Away, Handy, and Modcloth have all started targeting customers via direct mail, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/1/18048418/mail-marketing-coupons-away-casper-harrys-glossier\"><em>Vox</em> notes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s why direct mail is hot again and how your business can use it effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Why Direct Mail Is Hot</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4>Why is direct mail so hot? One reason is a higher trust factor. Younger consumers don’t associate direct mail with “junk mail” the way older consumers do. They’re more likely to attach that label to email.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Direct mail can be more effective. </strong>While direct mail and email marketing campaigns get similar response rates, a <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/329738/marketing-twofer-email-and-direct-mail-work-best.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=headline&amp;utm_campaign=112234&amp;hashid=7afvDCKTqy3G2Q05pHpphHLUD9k\">recent study</a> found direct mail campaigns generate purchases five times larger than email campaigns. Combining email with direct mail led to the best results of all: purchases six times larger than email alone generated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Direct mail stands out.</strong> Young people get hundreds of emails a day but only a few pieces of actual mail, notes one marketer quoted by <em>Vox</em>. In the same way digital-first companies such as Warby Parker and Glossier have begun opening physical stores to create a special experience, sending physical mail is a way to stand out from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Direct mail is more shareable.</strong> Unlike email that goes to one person, physical mail goes to a household. <a href=\"https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/does-direct-mail-or-email-deliver-greater-results-for-retailers/\"><em>RetailWire</em> reports</a> 88% of key purchase decisions for retail, financial and automotive categories are discussed at home, and direct mail pieces give recipients a reason to talk over the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Direct mail has a longer lifespan.</strong> Email has a lifespan of just a few seconds, <a href=\"https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/does-direct-mail-or-email-deliver-greater-results-for-retailers/\"><em>RetailWire </em>reports</a>, while direct mail’s average lifespan is 17 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Making Direct Mail Work</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4>If you want to get started with direct mail, you have several options, including postcards, catalogs or catalog-like booklets. There are even group mailers that combine several companies’ offers in an envelope. (<em>Vox</em> cites one company, Share Local Media, that’s targeting millennial Brooklyn hipsters with the type of mailers their parents used to get full of ads for mini blinds or power washing services.)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The option you choose will be based on your budget (direct mail isn’t cheap) and your goals. Once you’ve made a decision:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start with your existing customers.</strong> If your direct mail isn’t relevant to the recipient, it will hit the circular file. More than two-thirds (68%) of consumers immediately throw away mail from a brand or retailer they haven’t heard of. However, 76% will discuss mail from a brand or retailer they have purchased from in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Target your mailings. </strong>Focus your mailings on people who have expressed interest either in your business or your category. Two-thirds of consumers will discuss mail from a brand or retailer they’ve never heard of if the category is of interest to them; 54% will discuss mail from a brand/retailer they have heard of, but not purchased from. You can target customer demographics using the <a href=\"https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm\">USPS Every Door Direct Mail program</a>, buy or rent mailing lists from companies like <a href=\"https://www.infousa.com/marketing/direct-mail/\">InfoUSA</a> or <a href=\"https://www.directmail.com/mailinglists/\">DirectMail.com</a>, or create your own house mailing lists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Style it right. </strong>If you’re trying to attract millennial consumers, think of your direct mail pieces as physical Instagram posts. Keep the text brief, the layout streamlined and the photography eye-catching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make worthwhile offers.</strong> Email offers for discounts are a dime a dozen, clogging up the average millennial’s mailbox. But a glossy postcard or catalog with a special offer can catch the eye. Make it worth the customer’s while, not just a few dollars off.</p>\r\n"

If you’re sending out a direct mail piece promoting a sale on your store’s athletic shoes, for instance, include a URL that goes to a landing page for that specific offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don’t overload them.</strong> Direct mail is special precisely because your customers don’t get a lot of it. Carefully limit how often you send direct mail to avoid it becoming “spam” and eroding the recipient’s trust. For example, you could send direct mail with a special offer for a customer’s birthday, or after somebody makes their first purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Combine direct mail with email.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/329738/marketing-twofer-email-and-direct-mail-work-best.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=headline&amp;utm_campaign=112234&amp;hashid=7afvDCKTqy3G2Q05pHpphHLUD9k\"><em>Media Post</em></a> suggests starting with direct mail and following up a week later with email. It also recommends sending two emails for everyone piece of direct mail. You can make direct mail part of your automated marketing campaigns by setting up triggers to send direct mail after a prospect takes certain actions, just as you would with a drip email campaign. Both the email and the direct mail piece should use the same design elements and messaging to reinforce your brand and your offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Track results.</strong> Use landing page visits, coupon codes, and redemption rates to see how well your direct mail campaign is working.</p>\r\n"

        "blogSectionText": "<p>Before I share my ideas on how you can get past your fear of buying a franchise, I need to address this issue:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s perfectly normal to have feelings of fear when you’re thinking about buying a franchise. Let’s see if I can help alleviate some of these fears for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transition Fears</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’re probably worried about the transition you’ll be making if you decide to move forward with the franchise opportunity you’re interested in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transition I’m referring to is from employee to employer. And it’s a big one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason it’s so big is because of all the responsibilities you’ll have as the owner of a franchise. You’ll be responsible for things like:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiring</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payroll</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inventory</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expenses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And part of your fear has to do with the fact that you may not know how to do all of those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that when you’re a franchisee, you’ll receive formal training on every aspect of your franchise business. It’s part of what you’re paying for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, by the time you’re done with training, you’ll have the knowledge and the confidence you need to run your franchise business. As a result, your transition from employee to employer will be much smoother, and less scary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial Fears</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investments can be risky. That includes an investment in a franchise business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is, you can lose your money in a franchise business. That’s because franchising isn’t perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s why it’s important to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Make sure you can&nbsp;afford&nbsp;the franchises you’re investigating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;Choose and research&nbsp;the franchises you’re interested in carefully and methodically</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doing those two things can help you lower your risk, but I guarantee you’ll still be fearful about losing money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to walk through your fear is by doing everything you can to minimize your financial risk, like doing great research and staying within your budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear of Failure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fear tends to rear its ugly head right when you’re about to make your yes or no decision on the franchise opportunity you’ve been investigating. But don’t kid yourself; this fear has been a part of your psyche ever since you had your first call with franchise headquarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, what if you do fail? What will happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, unless you’re able to sell your business before you close it down, you’ll be out the money you invested up-front. You’ll also be out the money you’ve been putting into the business since it opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, you may owe money to vendors, your landlord, and the bank where you took out your&nbsp;small business loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, what I just described is very unpleasant in every respect. No one wants to lose money. But there’s something else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you fail at something, it affects you on the inside. You may feel like a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, it’s possible that you’ll feel like you’ve let others down, the ones who were rooting for you, your family and your friends. But things don’t have to go that way. You just have to be smart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upshot of all this is that while there’s a chance you’ll fail if you go into business as a franchise owner, there are specific things you can do to insure you’re making a good, well-thought out decision. Here they are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Take the time to learn everything you can about franchising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Make a commitment to only look at franchises you can afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Only look at franchises that offer an opportunity for you to use your top skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Do good research. That includes talking to 10 or more franchisees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Write a thorough and realistic&nbsp;business plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Hire an experienced franchise attorney who will look out for your best interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Don’t allow yourself to be rushed into anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Make sure those closest to you are on board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, while it can be scary to become your own boss, using the suggestions I included in this article will go a long way in lessening your fears, and may even increase your chances of success.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n"
